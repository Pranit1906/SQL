GROUP BY Clause With HAVING
Group by clause: GROUP BY clause is used to group selected rows and return a single row of summary information based on that group.
The group by clause can have following types of expressions: 

Constants 

Group functions 

The function SYSDATE 

The group by clause can contain not more than 255 expressions.
SELECT fieldname on which you group by, 
group function(fieldname),ï¿½. 
FROM tablename WHERE condition 
GROUP BY fieldname HAVING condition;

mysql> select Name,Location,count(Name)  from employee group by Location;
+--------+----------+-------------+
| Name   | Location | count(Name) |
+--------+----------+-------------+
| Jay    | Mumbai   |           2 |
| Yash   | Pune     |           2 |
| Annand | Chennai  |           1 |
| Ruhi   | Delhi    |           1 |
+--------+----------+-------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)




When to use Having clause: 

When you need to use a aggregate function in a condition.

Eg : Display those departments having minimum salary is less than 5000
SELECT deptno, MIN(sal) FROM emp WHERE MIN(sal) < 5000 GROUP BY deptno; 
Will give an error because where clause cannot have a Group function with GROUP BY clause. 

SELECT deptno, MIN(salary) FROM emp GROUP BY deptno HAVING MIN(sal)<5000;

mysql> select * from employee;
+----+--------+------------+--------+----------+
| Id | Name   | Department | Salary | Location |
+----+--------+------------+--------+----------+
|  1 | Jay    | HR         |   5000 | Mumbai   |
|  2 | Yash   | Management |   7000 | Pune     |
|  3 | Annand | Training   |   6000 | Chennai  |
|  4 | Ruhi   | Sales      |   4000 | Delhi    |
|  5 | Pratik | Admin      |   6000 | Pune     |
|  6 | Raj    | Training   |   5000 | Mumbai   |
+----+--------+------------+--------+----------+

mysql> select Department,min(salary) from employee group by Department having min(salary) < 5000;
+------------+-------------+
| Department | min(salary) |
+------------+-------------+
| Sales      |        4000 |
+------------+-------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)


mysql> select Department,min(salary) from employee group by Department having min(salary) > 5000;

| Department | min(salary) |
+------------+-------------+
| Management |        7000 |
| Admin      |        6000 |
