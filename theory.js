The number that the mayor has is 100000 is population of the city. With this number it is difficult to decide how many courses to be purchased for Male, females and children.

Mayor ordered his employee to do a survey and get the number of Male, females and children in the city.

After the survey they got the output as 40000 Male,40000 Female and 20000 are children.

In the above example,100000 population is processed through surveys to get output as 40000 Male,40000 Female and 20000 Children.
